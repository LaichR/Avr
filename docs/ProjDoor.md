# Lift Door

In this class project we control a simple model of a lift door. Part of this model is a DC motor and the motor driver, two light switches and the connected PC. The model is controlled through the metro board. It receives the user input from the PC (open door/close door) and controls the motor driver using the PWM generator. The light switches signals indicate when the motor has to stop again.
